Hey tony, I used this vid for deployment:

The live site is here:

The only attrs I have are from Deigan and Jr:

-Deigan helped me first out how to displays posts uses the lastest posts widget.
-Jr helped me figure out the current page selector to style the links for the current page.

All the other notes are in the styles.css in the firm folder.

I was able to hide various layout elements like post navigation and entry footers by either deleting the appropriate php in the .php files or by using css to display none which is commented in the styles.
